# Beep-Machine-Firmware

Current nightly firmware for Beep Machine Hardware.

Things to implement:

- Prove hardware functions (Pots, LEDs, Keys, Audio, MIDI)
- Create a test script for hardware
- Implement USB-MIDI and MIDI
- Intergrate/prove Oscillator code

Future Implementaions:

- Firmware upgrade procedure (hold reset button and connect to PC/Mac, drag and drop firmware) - Need to have a different name come up
- Lo-fi mode (Pots arent smoothed, allowing minute chanegs to alter pitch/other controls)
- Long button functions (Pages/Shift, LFO/?, Arp/?, Preset/Save)
- Start-up settings (MIDI channel, other funtions?)
- Multicore support (probably hadware functions on one side, oscillators on another)
